# W6_Exercises
A collection of exercises and labs from week 6 of LTCA

Week 6 dives deeper into Python and its more advanced functions.
Making use of imports and Pythons built-in function library, we are 
tasked with creating code that focuses on advanced string manipulation, 
classes and objects, and even creating our own functions.
